# Venue & Logistics Planning

## Overview

Venue selection and configuration is one of the most critical and complex aspects of conference planning. The venue sets the tone for the entire event and directly impacts attendee experience. This phase typically occurs 12-15 months before the conference.

## Venue Requirements

### Space Needs Assessment

**Essential Spaces**:
- **Main auditorium**: 300-400 capacity for keynotes
- **Parallel session rooms**: 3-4 rooms with 100-150 capacity each
- **Tutorial rooms**: 4-6 rooms with 30-50 capacity, power for laptops
- **Poster/exhibition space**: Open area for 50+ posters and sponsor booths
- **Registration/reception area**: High traffic capacity
- **Networking spaces**: Areas for breaks and informal meetings
- **Storage**: Secure space for materials and equipment
- **Quiet spaces**: For speakers, organizers, nursing mothers

### Technical Requirements

**Audio/Visual**:
- Professional AV systems in all session rooms
- Wireless microphones (handheld and lapel)
- High-quality projectors (minimum 1080p)
- Screen visibility from all seats
- Recording capabilities for sessions
- Live streaming infrastructure (optional but recommended)

**Power and Connectivity**:
- Sufficient power outlets in tutorial rooms (1 per 2 attendees minimum)
- Robust WiFi supporting 400+ concurrent connections
- Ethernet connections for streaming/recording
- Power strips available for common areas
- Power for sponsor and regisration check-in tables

## Case Study: Penn Pavilion Configuration (useR! 2025)

### Room Layout

**Penn Pavilion Breakdown**:
- **Room configuration**: Support for classroom (tables/chairs) and theater (chairs only) layouts
- **Penn 1**: 310 chairs theater; 192 classroom - Main keynote/plenary room
- **Penn 2**: 170 chairs theater; 105 classroom - Large parallel session room
- **Penn 3**: 7 tables/2 chairs ea. - Sponsor tables (limited power)
- **Lobby**: 3 tables, 6 chairs - Registration check-in and networking space
- **Coffee/tea break area**: 3 tables
- **Penn Garden**: 92 chairs theater; 54 classroom 
- **Gross Hall**: Multiple rooms, used as additional and backup spaces
- **Bostock Library The Edge**: Large classroom style room and small project rooms for R Dev Day

### Critical Lessons Learned

**Reconfiguration Timing**:
- Full reconfiguration of rooms requires **2-3 hours** clearing time
- If Day 1 ends at 8 PM, and a room needs reconfiguration, Day 2 cannot start before 10:00 AM
- For 8 AM start time, previous day must end by 4 PM
- Plan schedule around these constraints

**Power Limitations**:
- Penn 3 only has power in corners adjacent to Penn 1 & 2
- Required tech support to run power cords around room perimeter
- Check-in tables positioned outside Penn 3 in lobby; also required power runs

## Venue Selection Process

### Evaluation Criteria

Rate each venue on:
1. **Capacity fit** (not too large, not too small)
2. **Room flexibility** (ability to reconfigure)
3. **Technical infrastructure**
4. **Accessibility** (ADA compliance, public transport)
5. **Parking availability**
6. **Nearby hotels** (walking distance preferred)
7. **Catering options** (on-site vs. external)
8. **Cost structure** (transparent pricing)
9. **Support staff** availability
10. **Atmosphere** (professional yet welcoming)

### Contract Negotiation

**Key Terms to Negotiate**:
- Setup/breakdown time included in rental
- Cancellation and force majeure clauses
- AV equipment included vs. additional cost
- Staffing levels and overtime rates
- Liability and insurance requirements
- Payment schedule and terms

### Budget Considerations

**Example from useR! 2025**:
- Total venue cost: $10,427 from Conference & Event Services (CES)
