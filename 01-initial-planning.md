# Initial Planning for useR! Conference

## Overview

The initial planning phase (18-15 months before the conference) establishes the fundamental framework for the entire event. These early decisions cascade through all subsequent planning, making this phase critical for success.

## 1. Securing Host Institution and City

### Selection Criteria

The host institution should offer:
- **Academic partnership** in data science, statistics, or computational fields
- **Infrastructure** to support 300-400 attendees
- **Geographic accessibility** via major transportation hubs
- **Local R community** support and enthusiasm
- **Institutional backing** including administrative support

### Host Benefits

Hosting provides:
- International visibility for the institution
- Networking opportunities for faculty and students

- Strengthening of local R user community

### Commitment Requirements

## 2. Date Selection

### Critical Considerations

**Avoid conflicts with:**

- **Religious holidays** and observances

### Optimal Timing

- **Duration**: 3-4 days (typically Friday-Sunday or Thursday-Sunday)
- **Season**: Consider local climate and tourist seasons
- **Day of week**: Starting Thursday or Friday maximizes attendance
- **Note**: "Sometimes conflicts cannot be avoided" - prioritize the most critical factors

### Example from useR! 2025
