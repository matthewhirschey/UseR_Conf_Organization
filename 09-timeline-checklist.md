### Risk Points
Critical deadlines that cannot slip:

## Final Reminders

### Don't Forget
- Insurance must be active before contracts

- Dietary requirements affect all food planning
- Accessibility must be considered throughout
- International attendees need visa letters
- Recording consent needed from speakers
- Thank you messages matter immensely
