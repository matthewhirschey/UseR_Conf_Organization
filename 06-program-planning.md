## Session Planning

## Core Scheduling Principles

### Five Golden Rules
1. **Maximum 4 parallel tracks** - More creates choice paralysis
2. **Keynotes unopposed** - Everyone should be able to attend
3. **90-minute blocks** - Long enough for depth, short enough for focus
4. **30-minute breaks** - Essential for networking and movement
5. **Separate similar topics** - Avoid forcing attendees to choose between interests

## Tutorial Planning

### Balance Your 8 Tutorial Slots
- 2-3 beginner (R basics, tidyverse)
- 3-4 intermediate (Shiny, modeling, packages)
- 2-3 advanced (production R, deep learning)

### Instructor Timeline
- **T-2 months**: Confirm all instructors
- **T-1 month**: Get outlines and tech requirements
- **T-1 week**: Final prep and tech check

## Lightning Talks & Posters

### Lightning Talks

- Accept liberally from abstract submissions
- Single laptop, visible countdown timer

### Poster Session  
- 75-90 minutes with refreshments
- Space for 10-30 posters (4' × 4' each)
