# Catering & Hospitality

## Overview

Food service is typically 30-35% of your conference budget. Focus on coffee breaks and networking events - these are where the real value lies. Lunch can be optional or simplified to reduce costs and complexity.

## Essential Catering Components

### What You Actually Need

| Service | Per Person Cost | Priority | Notes |
|---------|----------------|----------|-------|
| **Coffee breaks** | $10-15 | Essential | 2 per day, drives networking |
| **Welcome reception** | $30-40 | Essential | First impression, key networking |
| **Lunch** | $25-35 | Optional | Can use meal vouchers or skip |
| **Conference dinner** | $60-100 | Optional | Only 60% typically attend |

### Planning Numbers

For a 200-person conference:
- Coffee breaks: Plan for 100% attendance
- Lunch: 85% if provided
- Welcome reception: 90%
- Conference dinner: 60%
- Always order 5% extra for dietary restrictions

## The useR! 2025 Approach: Simplification

Instead of traditional catering, useR! 2025 made strategic choices:
- **Lunch**: Attendees found their own (campus had many options)
- **Coffee breaks**: Full service with pastries and fruit
- **Welcome reception**: Heavy appetizers with beer/wine
- **Result**: Reduced complexity and cost while maintaining quality

## Dietary Requirements

### Must Accommodate
- Vegetarian (25% of attendees)
- Vegan (15%)
- Gluten-free (10%)
- Nut allergies (label everything)
- Religious dietary needs (Halal/Kosher if requested)

### Simple Management
1. Collect requirements during registration
2. Share summary with caterer 2 weeks before
3. Label all food clearly at event
4. Have 2-3 backup meals ready

## Coffee Break Formula

### Morning Break (per 100 people)
- 75 cups coffee (regular + decaf)
- 25 cups tea
- 150 pastries (1.5 per person)
- 100 pieces of fruit
- Setup 30 minutes before

### Afternoon Break (per 100 people)
- Same beverages
- Cookies instead of pastries
- Add soft drinks
- Consider healthier options

### Pro Tips
- Multiple stations prevent queues
- Place near session rooms
- Always have water stations
- Include clear signage

## Welcome Reception

### Simple Successful Format
- **Duration**: 2 hours
- **Style**: Standing cocktail reception
- **Food**: 8-10 pieces per person
- **Drinks**: Beer, wine, soft drinks (2 drinks/person/hour)
- **Setup**: Multiple food stations, high-top tables

### Budget Version
- Wine and beer only (no full bar)
- Cheese, crackers, vegetables, dips
- One hot appetizer
- Focus on networking space over fancy food

## Vendor Selection

### University Catering
**Pros**: Knows venue, simplified billing, often required
**Cons**: More expensive, less flexible

### External Catering
**Pros**: Competitive pricing, more options
**Cons**: May need special insurance, unfamiliar with venue

### Key Contract Terms
- Final headcount due 48 hours before
- Include service staff in price
- Clarify gratuity (often 18-24% added)
- Leftover food policy

## Cost-Saving Strategies

1. **Skip breakfast** - Hotels usually provide
2. **Make lunch optional** - Give meal cards or list nearby options
3. **Buffet over plated** - 30% cheaper
4. **Beer/wine only** - Skip full bar
5. **Sponsor specific meals** - "Lunch sponsored by..."
6. **Use university catering requirements creatively** - Coffee breaks might be mandatory, meals optional

## Key Decisions Checklist

- [ ] Buffet or plated service?
- [ ] Alcohol at reception? (beer/wine or full bar?)
- [ ] Conference dinner? (on-site or special venue?)
- [ ] Sponsor opportunities for meals?
- [ ] Dietary requirement collection method?
- [ ] Backup plan for problems?

## Final Advice

Remember: People come for the content and networking, not the food. Good coffee and ample networking time matter more than fancy meals. When in doubt, simplify. A well-executed coffee break beats a mediocre lunch service.
