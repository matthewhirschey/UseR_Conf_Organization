# Virtual Conference Option

## Overview

A virtual conference component provides global accessibility and extends the reach of useR! beyond physical attendance limitations. The useR! 2025 model demonstrates an effective hybrid approach: a separate virtual event held before the main conference, featuring pre-recorded content with optional solidarity donations to support the broader conference mission.

## The useR! Virtual Model

### Structure
- **Date**: One week before main conference (e.g. UseR 2025 Virtual was August 1, 2025)
- **Format**: Full-day virtual program on YouTube Premier
- **Content**: 24 pre-recorded talks from global contributors
- **Cost**: Free to attend with optional donations
- **Platform**: YouTube (accessible worldwide, no special software needed)

### Why This Model Works

**Benefits of Pre-Conference Virtual Event**:
- Avoids competing with in-person sessions
- Builds excitement leading up to main conference
- Allows presenters who can't travel to participate
- Creates additional content without venue constraints
- Reduces technical complexity during main event

**Accessibility First**:
- No registration fee required
- Available globally without travel
- Recorded for asynchronous viewing
- Closed captions can be added
- No bandwidth-heavy live streaming needed

## Content Strategy

### What to Include in Virtual Program

**Ideal Virtual Content**:
- Talks from presenters unable to travel
- Introductory/tutorial content for beginners
- Regional showcases from global R communities
- Student and early-career presentations
- Lightning talk compilations
- Special interest group meetings

**What to Keep In-Person Only**:
- Interactive workshops and tutorials
- Networking-heavy sessions
- Poster sessions
- Hands-on coding sessions
- Sponsor demonstrations

### Virtual Talk Requirements

**Technical Specifications**:
- Pre-recorded videos (15-20 minutes)
- 1080p resolution minimum
- Clear audio (external mic preferred)
- Screen sharing for code/slides
- Consistent format across talks

**Submission Package**:
- Video file (MP4 format)
- Slides (PDF)
- Abstract (250 words)
- Speaker bio and photo
- Code repository link

## Solidarity Payment Model

### The Donation Approach

**How It Works**:
- Registration is completely free
- During sign-up, option to make voluntary donation
- Suggested amounts: $5, $10, $25, or $50
- Frame as "supporting global R community access"
- Recognition for donors (if desired)

**Messaging Example**:
> "While virtual attendance is free, your solidarity payment helps us provide travel grants, reduce student fees, and ensure useR! remains accessible to the global R community. Every contribution makes a difference."

## Platform Selection
